### Aditional Detials I Would Like to Know

- How long have you been hearing these clicking noises?
- How much data do you have on this drive?
- What data do you specifically need for the meeting?

### Mocing Data from the Dying Disk
#### There are a bunch of different ways this can be done.

- One way is to use Onedrive or any other cloud service a company might have. You can store the files on the cloud and pull them down after a new drive has been installed on the device
- Another way is to get a hard drive duplicator to dupe (clone) the drive exactly how it is to a new drive.
- Also if there isn't a lot of data on the drive, one could also use a thumb drive or a big external drive to copy files and store them temporarily.

### Moving Data to a New System

- I already alluded to how I could retieve the data and put it on the new system but I will reiterate
Also I would definitey replace an HDD with a sata SSD. All user desktops and laptops should have an ssd of some sort in their machines just so productivity can take advantage of the higher read/ write speeds.
- I would use OneDrive or any other cloud storage solution to pull down the data an store the data on the new device.
- After the cloning process, the new drive should have the exact same file contents as the original hard drive
- One would use the thumb drive or external drive to transfer (copy paste) the data into the new drive.
